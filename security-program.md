### **Algorithm: Ransomware Defense Against LockBit 3.0**

1. **Initialize Security Parameters**  
   - Define `protected_folders` = [list of critical folders].  
   - Set `backup_schedule` = Daily/Weekly.  
   - Enable `real_time_monitoring`.  
   - Define `alert_recipients` = [Admin email/phone].

2. **Set Up Preventive Measures**  
   2.1 **System Hardening**  
   - Enable and configure firewall rules.  
   - Disable unnecessary services (e.g., SMBv1, Telnet, etc.).  
   - Regularly update the OS, antivirus software, and applications.  

   2.2 **Restrict Privileges**  
   - Assign `least_privilege_access` to users and applications.  
   - Enforce `MFA` (Multi-Factor Authentication) for all critical accounts.  
   
   2.3 **File Protection**  
   - Enable Controlled Folder Access for `protected_folders`.  
   - Use read-only or immutable backups for sensitive data.  
   
   2.4 **Application Security**  
   - Enable application whitelisting (`allowed_apps`).  
   - Block execution from risky directories (e.g., `%Temp%`, `%Downloads%`).  

3. **Deploy Monitoring and Detection Systems**  
   - Enable logging for system activities:
     - File access and modification events.
     - Registry changes.
     - Process execution.
   - Deploy behavior-based detection tools to identify unusual activities:
     - Mass file renaming.
     - High disk I/O.
     - Connections to known malicious IPs/domains.

4. **Real-Time Monitoring Algorithm**  
   ``` 
   while system_running:
       monitor(file_operations)
       if mass_file_rename_detected or high_disk_IO_detected:
           alert_admin("Potential ransomware activity detected.")
           isolate_system()
           halt_suspicious_processes()
   ```

5. **Backup Management**  
   - Schedule automated, **offline backups** for critical data:
     - Use encrypted, air-gapped backups.
   - Verify backups regularly for integrity.

6. **Restrict Network Activity**  
   6.1 **Network Segmentation**  
   - Divide the network into isolated zones (e.g., user, production, backup).  
   - Limit lateral movement with strict access controls.  
   
   6.2 **Outbound Connection Control**  
   - Block outgoing traffic to unknown IPs/domains.  
   - Use DNS filtering to prevent connections to malicious C&C servers.

7. **Respond to Ransomware Activity**  
   7.1 **Isolation**  
   - Disconnect affected devices from the network.  
   - Stop suspicious processes immediately.  

   7.2 **Recovery**  
   - Restore data from clean backups.  
   - Rebuild affected systems to ensure no lingering ransomware.  

   7.3 **Communication**  
   - Inform stakeholders and report incidents to cybersecurity authorities.

8. **Post-Incident Measures**  
   - Analyze attack logs to identify vulnerabilities.  
   - Patch security weaknesses.  
   - Update security policies.  
   - Train users to recognize phishing and other attack vectors.
